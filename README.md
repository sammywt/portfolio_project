# PORTFOLIO PROJECT

## Basic requirements

- Use semantic markup for HTML and CSS, adhering to best practices.
- Use CSS GID and Flexbox.
- Must be mobile mobile first, then tablet and desktop responsive.
- Must implement javascript to extend functionality by implementing 1 of the following
- AJAX requests
- Animations
- Javascript logic
- jQuery interactions
- Be deployed and accessible online via Github Pages.

## Initial thoughts

- Banner at very top with a clickable "home" (reset to landing page) button (center on mobile, top left on desktop)
    - Ideally scrolls with the page
    - Auto scroll/open hamburger nav menu in top right
        - Potentially replace nav icon with sections on desktop
- Underneath banner a visual representation for myself (EX Matt Farley page)
    - **BONUS** - behind banner, mouse tracking interactive image (EX Lianna Penn page)
- Include short brand statement underneath visual representation
- main sections underneath brand statement
- small additional contact link/ copyright at very bottom

### SECTIONS

Section title should be visible, and the section should expand to reveal content on click
- About Me
    - short (2-3 sentences) statement expanding on brand statement with some indication of personal style brought to table
- Skills
    - quick list with corresponding icons of technologies that can be utilized
        - potentially connect skills to projects (EX. jquery, found in project 1 and 2...)
- Projects
    - image of each project landing (main) page with short description in line
        - When project is clicked, should expand to a longer description with a more in depth explanation of the goal, outcomes, and skills used for the project along with a few more images and/or a link to view and interact with the project directly
- Contact
    - User input to fill in name, email, and about then submit the three inputs with one button


At very bottom, include a tiny bar with copyright, a "thanks for stopping by" message, and an additional nav bar to re-locate to the above elements in the main section

### Design:


- Monocolor for simplicity (shades of light green)
- Avoid sharp corners, solid dark lines
- Strict division of information and sections
- Information neatly compiled vertically (block) and centered
    - On desktop, the individual projects will utilize both block and inline display
